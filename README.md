# .spacemacs.d

My spacemacs configuration.

### Notes

* I'm using the [`develop` branch of `spacemacs`](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/tree/develop)

* You have to disable the `aj-javascript` layer for now because the original author
made his repository private and I'll have to set it up differently.
